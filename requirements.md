# Project Two
## Due Date: February 5th

## Stack
* ReactNative
* AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway
* DynamoDB/PostgreSQL


## Tools
Each group needs to add me to each of the following:
* Trello
  * Keep track of when each story was completed so you can make a Burndown Chart
* GitHub Repository

## Requirements
You need to create a Project Write-up, 2 to 3 paragraphs explaining what the project does, what roles the project includes, and what each of those roles can do. You should also explain what each layer of the application is in charge of.

* Front end needs to have responsibilites (like route guarding and validation and data manipulation)
* Back-end needs to have responibilities (authentication validation, data manipulation/calculations)
* Databases must have meaningful data storage. (You aren't building a game and saving the game state, you're actually creating data that needs to be saved and can be manipulated etc.)

1. There need to be at least 2 distinct roles in your application (user/employee/admin)
2. Those roles must have distinct functionality in your application.
3. You must come up with at least 15 user stories.
4. There must be a Burndown Chart as part of your presentation.

## Examples of past projects
* Games with messaging built in
* Dating apps
* Gacha games
* My-Fridge (tell app what ingredients you have, it spits out recipes)
* IMS (Inventory management system (ie: Vending Machine))
* Process Management Systems (TRMS)
